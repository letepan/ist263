        <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Have you traveled to the West Coast in the US? Maybe California? But have you traveled to Utah? Maybe not. But you definitely should! I recommend it if you like nature and exploring new places. There are many hiking trails. You should take a buddy or two. If not you can also travel alone but stay safe and don’t be out too late. Let's talk more about Utah! There’s a diverse scenery. There are five National Parks located in Utah.</p>
        
        <h4> The Five National Parks in Utah</h4>
        <ol>
            <li> Arches National Park - Known for more than 2,000 natural sandstone arches</li> <br>
            <li> Bryce National Park - Known for crimson-colored hoodoos </li> <br>
            <li> Canyonlands National Park - Known for the desert landscape carved by the Colorado River</li> <br>
            <li> Capitol Reef National Park - Known for its cliffs, canyons,and bridges in the Waterpocket Fold</li>
        </ol>

            <h5> Background Information</h5>
            <p> Hello, my name is Lizbeth Tepan and I’m currently 20 years old. Last year in May 2022, my friend asked me if I wanted to go on a trip to Utah. She mentioned why Utah would be a great place to travel to and I agreed with her. We did some research about the National Parks in Utah and we made a plan. Our trip lasted 6 days and we were able to witness different types of sceneries. For the most part, I took it all in and didn’t use my phone a lot (mainly for maps). However, I did capture some pictures and it still feels unreal that I was there! I would suggest people travel to the National Parks before sunrise because you’ll be able to find parking and  there won’t be a crowd of people. Also, when you are hiking it’s the coolest temperature in the morning and during the day the temperature rises. I hope you enjoyed my perspective on the Utah trip and encourage you to travel to Utah! </p>
