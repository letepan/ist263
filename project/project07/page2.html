            <p>I suggest you to buy a plane ticket to Salt Lake City Airport. To travel around the city, renting a car may be the easiest way. There are trains and buses but those may take too long or have their schedules. Having your car for the duration of the trip will make it 100% easier. Also, it's  important to keep in mind when you plan to travel to Utah. I traveled Mid May and it was the best decision because of the weather. You can travel during the months of April, May, and June(Spring time). This is specific for people that want to hike during their time in Utah. The costs may be cheaper during this time because most people travel during the summer and prices rise. </p>

            <h3>First Stop: Arches National Park </h3>
            <p>My friend and I landed at SLC Airport at noon we took a shuttle to the car-renting location. There are different renting companies and people pick up their car rentals. By taking another shuttle we were able to make it to the car and then drove to a small local restaurant for a food break. After this short stop, we drove to Walmart to get some essentials like bottled water, fruits, snacks, and other necessities. Our drive to the hotel was close to 4 hours but it flew by because during the drive we were able to see the beautiful skies and mountains surrounding us. However, when we made it to the hotel we were tired but excited for the following day. </p></div>

            <p> There are many different trails at the Arches National park and you decide to pick which ones you will take on that day. It depends on the time you arrive at the park and how much walking you plan on walking that day. During my trip, my friend and I decided on three different trails at the Arches and they were all beautiful in their own ways! The picture below was that start of the trail of my first hike of my Utah trip. </p>

            <p> This was a picture was taken when we did our 3rd hike at the Arches. I would consider it as the best Arch to view. There was a lot of people and we had to wait on line to take a picture with this big Arch. Everyone was nice and excited to see the Arch. After the picture was taken, my friend and I decided to have a snack break to recharge and go back to the car. After making it to the car we decided to get an early dinner and rest for the following day!

        <h4>Second Stop: Canyonlands National Park </h4>
        <p> On the third day of our trip, we woke up early to go to Canyonlands to watch the sunrise. We made it to the park and didnâ€™t see many cars at the parking lot which was awesome. However, there were a couple of people already at the top of the trail waiting for the sunrise. It was a beautiful scene and I took great pictures. After this, we took two more trails. We made sure to pack snacks in our backpacks and water. Later this day, we traveled to the second place we stayed in. It was an outdoor location and it was just before the sunset.Below are some of my images!</p>

        <p> The image above is a hiking spot at Canyonlands National Park. My friend and I decided to go to the park at 5:15am. From our hotel to the park, it took us about 30 minutes to get there. We made it to the hiking area just in time to watch the sunrise. The weather was just right as well. There were more than 30 people there. Many of them had there big cameras out taking pictures of the view. Just want to emphasize that waking up early is the best way to enjoy the most during the hiking days.  </p>

        <div class="col">
        <img src="../images1/utahrocks.jpg" alt="Canyonlands pink rocks" style="width:400px;height:500px;">
        <p> As you can see in my picture the sun was already up but the colors of the sky and rocks was beautiful. The time there was peaceful and it allowed me to enjoy nature. For the most part of the day. I didn't use my phone for social media or other apps. However, when I would see a beautiful view, I would quickly take out my phone to snap a picture. I enjoyed going to this National Park and will go back to watch the sunrise again!</p>
