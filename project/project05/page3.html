    <p>Third Stop: Bryce National Park. We woke up early again for the next park! By far, my favorite park. We took a long trail and it took us a couple of hours. After this one hike, we went to get lunch. Below are my pictures and they look awesome! </p>

    <p>Fourth Stop: Zion National Park. Our last park was the Zion! We were able to hike one trail but couldnâ€™t do one of the most popular ones because of restrictions and permits. Below are the pictures that I was able to take at the last park. We drove to a hotel in Las Vegas for our last two days. We took our second last evening and last day to explore Las Vegas. It looked like how I imagined based on the famous movies! Below are some of my pictures. 
    Lastly, we took a flight from Las Vegas Airport back to JFK, Queens, New York. I traveled overnight and made it to NY at 7 am. </p>
