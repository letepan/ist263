    <h1> Travel to Utah! </h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Have you traveled to the West Coast in the US? Maybe California? But have you traveled to Utah? Maybe not. But you definitely should! I recommend it if you like nature and exploring new places. There are many hiking trails. You should take a buddy or two. If not you can also travel alone but stay safe and don’t be out too late. Let's talk more about Utah! There’s a diverse scenery. There are five National Parks located in Utah. 
        
        1. Arches National Park 
        2. Bryce National Park 
        3. Canyonlands National Park 
        4. Capitol Reef National Park 
        5. Zion National Park

    <h2>My Background Information</h2>
    <p> Hello, my name is Lizbeth Tepan and I’m currently 20 years old. Last year in May 2022, my friend asked me if I wanted to go on a trip to Utah. She mentioned why Utah would be a great place to travel to and I agreed with her. We did some research about the National Parks in Utah and we made a plan. Our trip lasted 6 days and we were able to witness different types of sceneries. For the most part, I took it all in and didn’t use my phone a lot (mainly for maps). However, I did capture some pictures and it still feels unreal that I was there! I would suggest people travel to the National Parks before sunrise because you’ll be able to find parking and  there won’t be a crowd of people. Also, when you are hiking it’s the coolest temperature in the morning and during the day the temperature rises. I hope you enjoyed my perspective on the Utah trip and encourage you to travel to Utah!
